In the initial setup, the 2\u03a9 resistor is connected in one gap, and the unknown resistance R is connected in the other. Let the balance point be at length 'l' cm from the side with the 2\u03a9 resistor.  According to the principle of the metre bridge:\n\n   2\u03a9 / l  =  R / (100 - l)\n\n2. **Interchanging Resistances:** When the resistances are interchanged, the new balance point is shifted by 20 cm.  Since R > 2\u03a9, th"

We then use the mirror formula (1/f = 1/u + 1/v) to calculate the focal length (f).\n\n2. **Interpreting the observation:** The key observation is that when the student moves their eye to the left, the image appears to the right of the object pin. This is a parallax effect. It means the image is *further away* from the observer than the objec"
